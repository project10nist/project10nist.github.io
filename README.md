# My Learning Experience

[project10nist's Learning Log](project10nist.github.io)

Welcome! This is where I share my self-taught program in all things IT and work on my web development skills.

I'll make changes to both content and appearance as I learn new tricks. Since I still haven't gotten to @media declarations, you'll probably only get a decent view of this website on your desktop browser.

Feel free to contact me and share your own learning experiences: **project10nist411 (at) gmail (dot) com**
